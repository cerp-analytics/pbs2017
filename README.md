# PBS 2017 Census Data

This repository contains digitized data from Pakistan Bureau of Statistics's 2017 Census results. We converted them to csv format to help analysts and researchers make use of the data in research projects.

## Mapping data

We have also provided shapefiles for you to be able to map out the data and explore spatial patterns. The shapefiles are dated (2010) so use accordingly. We have also provided a key to link district names in PBS data to the shapefile attribute table. The source of these shapefiles is OCHA's admin boundaries database for Pakistan, among other sources. There are some differences between the boundaries between PBS and OCHA which are are more apparent at the tehsil / adm3 level. h/t to @suzairjunaid for pointing this out.
