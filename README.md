# PBS 2017 Census Data

This repository contains digitized data from Pakistan Bureau of Statistics's 2017 Census results. We converted them to csv format to help analysts and researchers make use of the data in research projects.

Data Source: https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/district-wise-results-tables-census-2017

## Organization

Each of the districts in the link above have 40 tables, broken down by tehsil / sub-division. The data folder will be organized by table number and contain various versions of the underlying raw data. All tables completed and uploaded are listed below - this is a work in progress.

For the most disaggregated version of data available, download tehsil_disaggregated or district_disaggregated version as per your needs.

## Mapping data

We have also provided shapefiles for you to be able to map out the data and explore spatial patterns. The shapefiles are dated (2010) so use accordingly. We have also provided a key to link district names in PBS data to the shapefile attribute table.
