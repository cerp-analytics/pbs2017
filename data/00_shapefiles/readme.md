## Mapping data

We have also provided shapefiles for you to be able to map out the data and explore spatial patterns. The shapefiles are dated (2010) so use accordingly. We have also provided a key to link district names in PBS data to the shapefile attribute table. The source of these shapefiles is OCHA's admin boundaries database for Pakistan, among other sources. There are some differences between the boundaries between PBS and OCHA which are are more apparent at the tehsil / adm3 level. In addition, the constituency boundaries correspond to the delineation of constituency boundaries done before the 2013 Election. 

h/t to @suzairjunaid for pointing this out.
